Pycoda is a thin wrapper on the CODA API.
See the comments at the top of api.py for examples of use.
For documentation of the API, see http://support.camvine.com/kb/api/

The Coda object constructs URLs on the fly, so if other methods are added at the CODA server, you should be able to call them without updating this library.
